Frankie, So Long is dialogue-driven game about saying goodbye. Developed with a childhood friend (writing, narrative design), a core motivation for the project was to develop a dynamic and expressive dialogue system that could communicate the subtle slurry of nostalgia and nerves we ourselves experienced leaving our rural hometown years ago. The project is currently scoped down to a demo version, which only includes the first area and conversation of the game. However, core systems are in place, and expanding the game is a matter of further asset creation.
